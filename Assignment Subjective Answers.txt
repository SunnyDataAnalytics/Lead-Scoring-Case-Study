. interested in finance, marketing and hr 
. those who are spending mopre time on website
. leads who has statble financial background

2. What are the top 3 categorical/dummy variables in the model which should be focused the most on in order to increase the probability of lead conversion?

>> The top threee categorical variables are
a. Those who are trying to specalized course are more likely to be converted.
b. Those who are working professional has high chance to be converted , and
c. Those who are spending time on website are more likely to be converted.

3. At first, we need to target those who has a stable income source or who simply want to switch their profession. We need to sort out those who has spent more time X Education's website. After sorting out, we need to tell them about the course fee and then the scholarship that can be provied right now. From this , it is possible to convert as many of them as possible.

4. This time the focus need to be on those who have both stable income and are willing to switch there profession.
